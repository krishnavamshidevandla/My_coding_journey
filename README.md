# My_coding_journey
I'm here to post all the DSA questions I practice everyday along with the my solutions

Here you can find [solutions](#Solutions) for various coding/algorithmic problems.
Also, this repo will be updated with new solutions time to time.

## Solutions

Algorithms and data structures are not language-specific (it's true that some languages are faster, and some are easier to use), but if you are good with the logic and pseudocode, any language would be good.
But I have decided to use python as I prefer to use it more. You can use language of your choice
